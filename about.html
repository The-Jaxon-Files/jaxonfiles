                  <h2>Jackson Isenberg</h2>
                  My name is Jackson Isenberg. I am a first year at the
                  Georgia Institute of Technology and am majoring in computer science.
                  I am the founder and owner of The Jaxon Files and have been running the site since
                  it was a small subdomain back in 2015. As my opening to the world of programming,
                  this website introduced me to web development and served later as a gateway to
                  my knack for artificial intelligence, scriptures, OOP, and operating systems.
                  I currently serve as the head mentor for the Alpharetta High School Robotics Club after
                  graduating as the Vice-President of the club in 2020. My hobbies and interests include
                  programming, educating, writing, drawing, and watching anime.

                  My name is Adithya Vasudev, and I am a freshman at the Georgia Institute of Technology majoring
                  in computer science. I am a contributor to The Jaxon Files, mainly working on the math section since 2020.
                  I aim to use The Jaxon Files platform as a means of spreading my knowledge and teaching resources to a greater audience.
                  My hobbies include programming, teaching, and sports.
